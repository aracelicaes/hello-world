Hi y'all!
My name is Ara, I am new to the web development world and I am excited to learn about it. I am currently learning chinese and italian and I hope to be able to hold a small conversation at the end of the year. I love music, dancing and all types of art. I was born and grew up in different parts of Mexico and I lived in the USA for 4 years. I must say I love both cultures, and they are definitely embedded in me. I am married to a wonderful man named Leo. We have known each other for 6 years and we've been married and sealed for 4 years. Life is wonderful.
